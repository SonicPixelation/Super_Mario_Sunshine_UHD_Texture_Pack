<h3>TLDR: Free upscales and retextures of the whole game.  Check "Prefetch Custom Textures" in the "Advanced" tab of the Graphics settings on the 5.0 build of Dolphin to prevent stuttering.</h3>

title : If someone could send me a link to a high resolution image of the North American title art that would awesome. I haven't been able to find it. I know Nintendo artists had to of drawn the title at a high resolution because it is printed very large on the player's guides of this game. If anyone could take a high quality photo or scan of the official Nintentdo or Prima player's guide that would be better than the current upscale of the in-game title. <br>
tree shadows : some of the original tree shadows create a white box around the trees, does anyone know how to fix this?<br>

<h3>-About the pack-</h3>

The most popular high-res texture pack on the Dolphin forums right now is <a href="https://forums.dolphin-emu.org/Thread-super-mario-sunshine-uhd-texture-pack?pid=431952#pid431952">razius</a>'.  Unfortunately, even with a few new additions, after four years it only contains textures for the HUD, menus, trees, tile flooring (not even walls or roofs) of Delfino Plaza, some shadows, and all the trees.  Only one goo texture is included.  Although he says he's tried to "keep everything as close to the original as possible", most of the pack doesn't even come close to respecting the simplistic style of the original game.  The SMG style grass and Skyrim-esque tree textures are the worst offenders.  These textures fail to fit in with the rest of the game and stick out as obvious mods, preventing first time players from enjoying the original aesthetics of the game.  Some textures, most notably the location textures, even ignore the original gradients and/or coloring of the original textures.

In spite of my disappointment with most of the pack, I was inspired by the pink goo texture.  The pink goo texture looked so good that I decided to upscale all the other goo textures and soon I was motivated to create a definitive UHD texture pack for the whole game.

I've been using <a href="https://github.com/nagadomi/waifu2x">waifu2x</a>, a free, web-based upscaler that uses deep convolutional neural networks, and I've gotten some incredible results out of it.  I manually ran each texture through waifu2x, and inspected them, testing settings to see what looked best.  I used Bighead's Custom Texture Powershell script to make the goo and other seamless textures, big thanks to him!  A few original textures are too low-res for waifu2x to make good upscales with.  Using Gimp, I upscaled textures and manually smoothed out the edges of pollution maps, low-res banners, letters, text, and small character maps.  I also manually retextured certain textures that I felt required more than just upscaling to be acceptable in a UHD pack.  Most notably the main menu A, B, and C save blocks were retextured.  For the wanted poster, I edited a screenshot from an in-game cutscene that shows the poster at a higher resolution.

<h3>I hope that you, the player, will feel like you're not even using a texture mod pack, yet have a superior graphical experience.</h3>

Make sure to check "Prefetch Custom Textures" in the "Advanced" tab of the Graphics settings on the 5.0 build of Dolphin, this will cache the custom textures to RAM when Dolphin loads the game. This will prevent all stuttering caused by using custom textures. This texture pack should only load less than 2 GB to RAM (without the goo maps) which shouldn't be a problem for computers capable of playing the game at UHD smoothly anyway.

I will upload UHD video footage to Youtube late January/early February.

Enjoy!
