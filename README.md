<h3>-About the pack-</h3>

The most popular high-res texture pack on the Dolphin forums right now is <a href="https://forums.dolphin-emu.org/Thread-super-mario-sunshine-hires-texture-pack">razius</a>'.  Unfortunately, even with a few new additions, after four years it only contains textures for the HUD, menus, trees, tile flooring (not even walls or roofs) of Delfino Plaza, some shadows, and all the trees.  Only one goo texture is included.  Although he says he's tried to "keep everything as close to the original as possible", most of the pack doesn't even come close to respecting the simplistic style of the original game.  The SMG style grass and Skyrim-esque tree textures are the worst offenders.  These textures fail to fit in with the rest of the game and stick out as obvious mods, preventing first time players from enjoying the original aesthetics of the game.  Some textures, most notably the location textures, even ignore the original gradients and/or coloring of the original textures.

In spite of my disappointment with most of the pack, I was inspired by the pink goo texture.  The pink goo texture looked so good that I decided to upscale all the other goo textures and soon I was motivated to create a definitive UHD texture pack for the whole game.

I've been using <a href="https://github.com/nagadomi/waifu2x">waifu2x</a>, a free web-based upscaler that uses deep convolutional neural networks, and I've gotten some incredible results out of it for certain textures.  Some original textures that are too low-res or have sharp edges, were not upscaled with waifu2x.  Using Gimp, I manually upscaled and smoothed out the edges of pollution maps, low-res banners, letters, text, and small character maps.  I also manually retextured certain textures that I felt required more than just upscaling to be acceptable in a UHD pack.  Most notably the main menu A, B, and C save blocks were retextured.  For the wanted poster, I edited a screenshot from an in-game cutscene that shows the poster at a higher resolution.

<h3>I hope that you, the player, will feel like you're not even using a texture mod pack, yet have a superior graphical experience.</h3>

Make sure to check "Prefetch Custom Textures" in the "Advanced" tab of the Graphics settings on the 5.0 build of Dolphin, this will cache the custom textures to RAM when Dolphin loads the game. This will prevent all stuttering caused by using custom textures. This texture pack should only load less than 2 GB to RAM (without the goo maps) which shouldn't be a problem for computers capable of playing the game at UHD smoothly anyway.

I will upload UHD video footage to Youtube soon and will also release this pack in DDS format.

Enjoy!
