The most popular high-res texture pack on the Dolphin forums right now is <a href="https://forums.dolphin-emu.org/Thread-super-mario-sunshine-hires-texture-pack">razius</a>'. Unfortunately, it only contains retextures for the HUD, menus, trees, tile flooring (not even walls or roofs) of Delfino Plaza, some shadows, and all the trees.  There's only one goo texture that's been upscaled, pitiful.  Although he says he's tried to "keep everything as close to the original as possible", most of the retextures do not respect the look and feel of the original game.  The SMG style grass and Skyrim-esque tree retextures are the worst offenders.  The HUD and menu textures are unbearably sharp and do not respect the simplicity or style of the originals.  These retextures fail to fit in with the rest of the game and stick out as obvious mods, preventing first time players from enjoying the original aesthetics of the game.

In spite of my disappointment with the rest of the pack, I was inspired by the upscale of the pink goo texture.  It looked so good that I decided to upscale all the other goo textures and soon I was motivated to create a definitive UHD texture pack for the whole game.

I've been using&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/nagadomi/waifu2x">waifu2x</a>&nbsp;and I've gotten some incredible results out of it for certain textures.  &nbsp;Some original textures that are too low-res or have sharp edges, were not upscaled.  I was able to manually upscale and smooth out the edges of pollution maps, low-res banners, and small character maps.

<h3>My goal with this pack is to make players feel like they're not even using a texture mod, yet provide an obviously superior graphical experience over the original game.</h3>

The optional pollution maps have a prefix character space, simply delete the underscore to use these textures.
