Attention content creators, I will give front page credit (^ above) on this GitHub project to anyone that wants to contribute to this pack.  Instead of getting lost in the forums your content will be included with the latest version of this pack as a single download.

<h3>¡Update! </h3>
I've already replaced most of razius' textures that will no longer be included in this pack.  If anyone wants to retexture the map, Mario, and Fludd textures to replace razius' that would make this pack encompass the full game once again and people will not have to download razius' pack and mix and match.  At the moment, if you want the map, Mario, and Fludd textures I encourage you to take the time to add them manually.  In the text file "qashto_recommended_textures.txt", I've written down the names of the textures I recommend and would add from razius' pack.

<h3>-About the pack-</h3>

The most popular high-res texture pack on the Dolphin forums right now is <a href="https://forums.dolphin-emu.org/Thread-super-mario-sunshine-hires-texture-pack">razius</a>'.  Unfortunately, even after a few new releases, it only contains textures for the HUD, menus, trees, tile flooring (not even walls or roofs) of Delfino Plaza, some shadows, and all the trees.  Only one goo texture is included.  Although he says he's tried to "keep everything as close to the original as possible", most of the pack does not respect the look and feel of the original game.  The SMG style grass and Skyrim-esque tree textures are the worst offenders.  Most of the HUD and menu textures are unbearably sharp and do not respect the simplistic style of the originals.  These textures fail to fit in with the rest of the game and stick out as obvious mods, preventing first time players from enjoying the original cartoony aesthetics of the game.

In spite of my disappointment with most of the pack, I was inspired by the pink goo texture.  I also thought a few shadows, the Noki Bay tiles, a few menu textures, Mario, Fludd, and many miscellaneous small textures were excellent and I included them in this pack, until razius through a fit and I had to take them out.  The pink goo texture looked so good that I decided to upscale all the other goo textures and soon I was motivated to create a definitive UHD texture pack for the whole game.

I've been using <a href="https://github.com/nagadomi/waifu2x">waifu2x</a>, a web based neural network upscaler, and I've gotten some incredible results out of it for certain textures.  Some original textures that are too low-res or have sharp edges, were not upscaled with waifu2x.  Using Gimp, I manually upscaled and smoothed out the edges of pollution maps, low-res banners, and small character maps.  I also manually retextured certain textures that I felt were unacceptable for a UHD pack, most notably the main menu A, B, and C save blocks.  For the wanted poster, I edited a screenshot from an in-game cutscene that shows the poster at a higher resolution.

<h3>I hope that you, the player, will feel like you're not even using a texture mod pack, yet have a superior graphical experience.</h3>

Make sure to check "Prefetch Custom Textures" in the "Advanced" tab of the Graphics settings on the 5.0 build of Dolphin, this will cache the custom textures to RAM when Dolphin loads the game. This will prevent all stuttering caused by using custom textures. This texture pack should only load less than 2 GB to RAM (without the goo maps) which shouldn't be a problem for computers capable of playing the game at UHD smoothly anyway.

The experimental pollution maps have an underscore prefix to prevent them from being loaded, simply delete the underscore to use these textures.  These textures are very small (a few kilobytes), but for some reason when Dolphin loads these textures they add hundreds of megabytes or more to the total load, depending on the map.  Does anyone know why this happens and could help me solve this issue?

Please report any issues you experience on the issues forum of the GitHub page.  Post your own additions/changes you would like to make to this pack as comments on this thread and if they're good I'll add them to the pack.  I will upload UHD video footage to Youtube soon.

Enjoy!
